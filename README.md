# Powerlog
Final project for 4iz278 Web applications.
The assignment was to create simple web application with php backend and MySQL database.

## My solution
I have created log app for performances in the gym.
Appart from basic utility like login, registration and settings, user could log their performances,
compare themselves to other lifters in their category, see their progress in the simple graphs, add
other users as friends and compare performances with their friends.

For graphs I used CanvaJS library, frontend is styled with Bulma.
The app is secured against SQL injections, XSS attacks.

The user credentials for mysql are not valid :)
